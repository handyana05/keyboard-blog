## What makes a mechanical keyboard quiet?

A keyboard’s sound profile depends on more than just the switch. For office use, these factors matter most:

### 1. Switch type
- **Linear switches** (e.g., Silent Red) are the quietest
- **Silent tactile switches** (e.g., Silent Brown) offer feedback with minimal noise
- **Clicky switches** should be avoided entirely

### 2. Case construction
Keyboards with internal foam or thicker cases reduce hollow sounds and echo.

### 3. Stabilizers
Poor stabilizers cause rattling on large keys like Space and Enter. Well-tuned stabilizers make a big difference.

### 4. Desk surface
Hard desks amplify sound. A desk mat alone can noticeably reduce noise.
